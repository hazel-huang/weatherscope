# weatherscope
Weatherscope is a series of animated weather simulations produced using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can switch between three different weather states (sunny, cloudy, & rainy) by clicking on the "weatherscope" title.

I created this project to test my front end development skills while exercising my design skills. Weatherscope can be used as a relaxing stimulant to help centre your mind or practice mindfulness.

Please download the zip file and open the html file to view this project.

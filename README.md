# weatherscope
Weatherscope is a series of animated weather simulations produced using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can switch between three different weather states (sunny, cloudy, & rainy) by clicking on the "weatherscope" title.

I created this project to combine my design skills and eye for aesthetic with my web development skills. Weatherscope can be used as a relaxing stimulant to help the user centre their mind or practice mindfulness.
